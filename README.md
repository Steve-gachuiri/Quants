# Quantitative Methods Repository

This repository contains a collection of scripts and analyses for quantitative methods, focusing on cross-sectional data analysis, time series analysis, panel data analysis, econometrics, and statistical modeling. It is designed to showcase techniques and approaches for data analysis in R.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into three main branches, each focusing on a specific type of data analysis:

1. Cross-Sectional Data Analysis
2. Time Series Data Analysis
3. Panel Data Analysis

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Quantitative-Methods.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the appropriate branch (e.g., `Time-Series-Data-Analysis`) to access scripts.
   ```bash
   git checkout Time-Series-Data-Analysis
   ```
3. Ensure required libraries are installed before running the scripts.
   ```R
   install.packages(c("wooldridge", "dynlm", "lmtest", "sandwich", "fUnitRoots", "tidyverse"...))
   ```
